# Library Management System
A Library Management System made with Python & PyQt5

## Is this app good to use ?
with no controls over input, extremely stupid database management and very very VERY serious security vulnerabilities => all of that
and many more makes this app not even remotly close to be called usable !!!!!!

## Why the F*** did I make it then
Good question ! very good question indeed ! <br /> 
this app was made during the quarantine caused by the COVID-19 outbreak ! <br /> 
it was a way for me to learn new stuff (obviously I'm not talking about good coding practices xD), I'm talking about GUIs in python, and how to make it into an exe and install it on a client machine. <br /> 
that's why I'm going to repeat this one last time: this app is EXTREMELY stupid and vulnerable! so don't judge me !!!!
